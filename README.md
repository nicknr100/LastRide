# LastRide

[![CI](https://github.com/nicknr100/LastRide/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nicknr100/LastRide/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**LastRide (帰り時) tells people out at night in Japan when they need to start
walking to catch the last train home — and what to do if they miss it.**

Save one or more destinations — Home, Work, a friend's place, or anywhere else
— and choose where you're heading tonight. The app finds the stations near you,
works out the walking time to each, looks up tonight's last train to the active
destination, and shows a single leave-by time: the last train's departure minus
the walk minus a few minutes to get from the entrance to the platform. As you
move during the evening the plan follows you, and reminders are rescheduled.

- **Leave screen** — a reliability-aware recommended leave time, the absolute
  latest practical deadline, a live countdown, route freshness, current service
  disruptions, the route home (lines, transfers, arrival, fare), and nearby
  stations. Automatic station choice can avoid a disrupted route and widens its
  search when routes are scarce or disrupted.
- **Reminders** — at the intervals you choose before leave-by, again when it's
  time to go, and once more just after the last train has gone, in case you
  missed it. They run while night-out tracking is on, which switches itself off
  once the night's alerts are done.
- **If missed** — the first train and its route, a taxi estimate with regional
  late-night rates, walking home when it's close, and net cafés, karaoke,
  capsule hotels and hotels nearby, compared by what you'd pay and when you'd
  get home.
- **LastRide for Business** — organizers can create a nomikai event and share
  a join code/link. Participants stay accountless and share only their chosen
  display name and calculated leave-by time; organizer devices receive
  departure alerts without gaining access to participants' home, route or
  location.
- Japanese and English throughout, including romanized station and line names.

Times come from [駅すぱあと API](https://api-info.ekispert.com/) (real
timetables, including weekends and holidays) and stations, walking routes, taxi
estimates and places from [NAVITIME](https://api-sdk.navitime.co.jp/api/) via
RapidAPI. Both are called by the API server in this repo, so provider keys stay off
people's phones and answers are cached. Production builds require an HTTPS API
origin and keep public OpenStreetMap/Photon community fallbacks disabled by
default; those fallbacks remain available only for development or explicitly
opted-in test builds.

**Layout:** `artifacts/last-ride` is the Expo (React Native) app,
`artifacts/api-server` the Express API server, and `lib/` holds the OpenAPI spec
plus the client and validators generated from it. See `replit.md` for how to run
the existing development stack, `.env.example` for the configuration contract,
`docs/enterprise-deployment.md` for Business bring-up, and `infra/README.md`
for the staged/production AWS release workflow.

Database schema changes use committed Drizzle migrations:

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/db generate  # create migration after a schema change
pnpm --filter @workspace/db migrate   # apply committed migrations to DATABASE_URL
```

The production API can be built on any Docker-capable host with
`Dockerfile.api`; run migrations as a separate release step before deploying
a new image.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm run typecheck   # libraries and apps
pnpm run test        # unit tests (Vitest)
```

Both run in CI on every push and pull request.

`artifacts/last-ride/tests/` covers the app's pure logic — no React Native
components are rendered, these are plain functions run in Node.

- **`time.test.ts`** — the Japan-time helpers. JST is treated as UTC+9 whatever
  the device is set to, and the rail service day starts at 04:00, so a 00:31
  train belongs to the previous evening.
- **`planner.test.ts`** — the night plan. The five `rideStatus` states and the
  exact boundaries between them, the reminder schedule, and the backstops that
  end the night (the last train counts as gone by 01:30, tracking stops by
  04:00, the night is over by 05:00).

Several rules tested there are product decisions, not implementation details:
the 3-minute hard station buffer, the reliability margin used for the
recommended departure, the 30-minute warning, disruption-aware station
selection, adaptive station search, and the 10 minutes a farther healthy
station must gain to be worth a longer walk. See
`docs/reliability-planning.md`. The tests exist so those rules cannot change
by accident.

`@/lib/api` is stubbed under Vitest (`tests/stubs/api.ts`) because the real
module imports `react-native` at load time, which Vite cannot parse. Nothing
under test makes a request. See `vitest.config.ts`.
