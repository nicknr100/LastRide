/**
 * Unit tests for the app's pure logic (time arithmetic, ride planning).
 *
 * `vite-tsconfig-paths` resolves the `@/` alias from tsconfig.json so tests
 * import modules exactly as the app does. Nothing here renders React Native
 * components — these are plain functions, run in Node.
 *
 * `@/lib/api` is the one exception: it pulls in react-native and
 * expo-constants at import time, which Vite cannot parse (Flow syntax). It is
 * swapped for a stub, since the functions under test never issue a request.
