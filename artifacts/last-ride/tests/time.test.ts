/**
 * Tests for the Japan-time / service-day helpers.
 *
 * This is the riskiest arithmetic in the app: everything downstream (when to
 * leave, when the last train has gone, when the night is over) is derived from
 * it, and an off-by-one here is invisible until 00:30 on a weeknight.
 *
 * Two rules are being pinned down:
 *   - JST is always UTC+9, regardless of the device's own time zone.
 *   - A rail "service day" starts at 04:00, so a 00:31 train belongs to the
 *     previous evening.
