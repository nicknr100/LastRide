/**
 * Tests for the night plan: what the app tells the user to do, when it
 * notifies them, and when it stops tracking their location.
 *
 * These are the decisions with consequences. A wrong `rideStatus` tells
 * someone to relax when they should be running; a wrong `trackingEndsAt`
 * leaves background location running all night and flattens their battery.
 *
 * Several of the rules here are product decisions that currently live only in
 * comments — the 3-minute station buffer, the 30-minute warning, the
 * 10-minute gain needed to justify a farther station, the 01:30/04:00/05:00
 * backstops. Pinning them down is the point: they should not be able to change
 * by accident.
